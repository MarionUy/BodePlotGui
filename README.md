BodePlotGui

A MATLAB GUI for drawing asymptotic Bode diagrams

The code here is useful for people trying to learn how to draw asymptotic Bode diagrams.  The code takes as input a single-input single-output transfer function and generates the asymptotic approximation along with a description of how the approximation was developed.
